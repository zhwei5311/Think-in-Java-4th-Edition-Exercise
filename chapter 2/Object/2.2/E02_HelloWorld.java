/****************** Exercise 2 ******************
 * Follow the HelloDate.java example in this
 * chapter to create a "hello, world" program that
 * simply displays that statement. You need only a
 * single method in your class (the "main" one that
 * executes when the program starts). Remember
 * to make it static and to include the argument
 * list (even though you don't use it).
 * Compile the program with javac and run it using
 * java. If you are using a different development
 * environment than the JDK, learn how to compile
 * and run programs in that environment.
